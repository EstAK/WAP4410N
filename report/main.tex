\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Context}
Nowadays most IOT devices contain some flavor of a vulnerability, backdoor or critical bug. However, thoses problems in some cases are never fixed as IoT devices are dependent on their vendors for firmware update due their code being proprietary (in most cases). Furthermore, some users might forget (or not know) that their device's software is not udated and by extension, vulnerable. The goal of this project is to show how easy or un-easy it is to dump, find and exploit a wifi router firmware.
